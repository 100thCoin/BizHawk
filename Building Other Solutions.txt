Besides the main Bizhawk.sln, there are a number of other projects, each with its own build method.  To develop on Bizhawk, you do not need to build these other projects, as they are included prebuilt in GIT.  You need only build them if you want to modify the cores themselves.

----------------------------------
BUILDING .DLL FOR WINDOWS:

--> When "vs2019" is mentioned, this means Microsoft(R) Visual(R) Studio(R)(R) 2019(TM) using the latest version with all the normal toolchains installed.
Unless otherwise specified, the build process consists simply of building the sln; the dlls are automatically output to the appropriate place.

--> When "mingw" is mentioned, this means a 64 bit gcc setup installed by https://www.msys2.org/.

lynx: use lynx/msvc/bizlynx.sln
wonderswan: use wonderswan/msvc/bizswan.sln
libretrobridge: use LibretroBridge/msvc/LibretroBridge.sln
quicknes: use quicknes/msvc/libquicknes.sln
libgambatte: use libgambatte/libgambatte.sln.
octoshock (psx): use psx/octoshock/bizhawk/octoshock.sln

libmupen64plus: 
Use mupen64plus-sln/projects/msvc11/mupen64plus.sln.
These are actually a mishmash of vs2010 and vs2013 projects.
It will be difficult to build this without having vs2010 and vs2013 installed.
Currently, we are stuck due to out of date mupen code and prebuilt static libraries.
If you have the skills required to modify our mupen core, please send us a postcard to let us know and consider volunteering for the BizMupen Rehabilitation Team where we will redo the core on latest master.

mgba: use mingw to build mgba/src/platform/bizhawk/mingw/Makefile

melonds: ??

waterbox:  See separate document waterbox/readme.txt

libdarm: stock build from https://github.com/jbremer/darm.git   71a027e0ffb2171d01213c6ecc6da1c49e158398 ????
